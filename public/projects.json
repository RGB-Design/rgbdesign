The project reimagines the future of urban environments through adaptive spatial infrastructure. The system transcends traditional architectural boundaries by introducing a Prototypical System composed of intelligent, self-assembling units capable of dynamic reconfiguration in response to urban needs and changes. These spheroidal units, equipped with telescopic legs and electromagnets, interact and rearrange themselves into various urban elements, demonstrating collective intelligence and flexibility. Beyond mere physical structures, Orb[i]s integrates advanced sensory systems and machine learning to enhance user interaction and adaptability, offering a visionary approach to urban development that champions adaptability, responsiveness, and the seamless integration of technology and architecture to foster new forms of cultural and urban spaces."

Through extensive experiments and iterations, Rhinovault was used to rationalise the architectural form, showcasing a harmonious balance of horizontal equilibriums. This innovative design not only enhances the square's aesthetic appeal but also introduces a self-supporting and stable structure, seamlessly integrating with the urban fabric of Zürich. Explore the intersection of functionality and beauty through the study of Vaults, paving the way for a visionary approach to contemporary architecture."

A temporary, yet Sustainable seater was made entirely out of 100% Recycled Paper Tubes (usually found as a refuse at Print stores). The installation was built to provoke the idea of Reduce- Reuse-Recycle and stood true to this idea by minimising the amount of waste generated even in the process of fabrication. All the segments of the seater were efficiently designed to make optimal use of the limited material available. The temporary yet sustainable Installation was used by several artists for their performances.The seater endured 1000’s of users and uses whilst serving a different function/experience to each one."

Eschewing traditional adhesives, this innovative process separates tetra pack components, recycling them into durable, aesthetic sheets for construction, without generating waste. Inspired by the game 'tetris', TETR.IS's modular form visually represents the challenge of tetra pack waste, embodying a zero-waste, closed-loop lifecycle. This project not only highlights environmental sustainability but also redefines material reuse, setting a new standard for eco-friendly design."
